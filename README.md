# 📦 Retail Supply Chain Analysis (Tableau Dashboards)
This project presents an end-to-end Retail Supply Chain Analysis using Tableau to uncover actionable insights from sales, returns, shipping, and profitability data. The analysis is based on a dataset of over 5,000 customer orders and is visualized through six interactive dashboards, each focusing on a key area of retail performance.

##📊 Dashboards Included:
- Overview Dashboard – High-level KPIs like total revenue, profit, AOV (Average Order Value), # of orders, and return rate.

- Profit Dashboard – Profit trends over time, profit by category/state, and identification of loss-driving products or regions.

- Orders Dashboard – Distribution of orders by category, state, and customer segment, with insights into high-volume buyers.

- Returned Orders Dashboard – Analysis of return rate, top returned products, and its impact on profit.

- Products Dashboard – Product-level performance including revenue, quantity sold, units per order, and average price.

- Shipping Dashboard – Shipping duration and its correlation with profitability across regions.

🔍 Key Insights:
- Texas has a high order volume but generates losses due to bulk buying of low-margin items.

- Q4 generates the highest profits due to seasonal demand and lower return rates.

- Certain products consistently cause losses due to high return rates and poor shipping performance.

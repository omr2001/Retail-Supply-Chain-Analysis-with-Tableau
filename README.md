# Retail-Supply-Chain-Analysis-with-Tableau
This project presents an end-to-end Retail Supply Chain Analysis using Tableau to uncover actionable insights from sales, returns, shipping, and profitability data. The analysis is based on a dataset of over 5,000 customer orders and is visualized through six interactive dashboards, each focusing on a key area of retail performance.
